## Built with


**Language:** Python,Html,Css,Javascript

**Libraries:** Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Sckit learn,Joblib

**Web framework:** Flask

**Cloud Service:** Heroku


  
## Lessons Learned

- Planned to use 2 different data set but second data set modelling did not perform consistently.
- Focused more on hyperparamter tuning to increase model's accuracy.
- Spent an ample amount of time designing UI using Html,Css and a bit of Javascript.
